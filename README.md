## Introduction

Intel FastGo provides optimized Go packages, such as compress/flate and compress/gzip, for Go applications running on the Xeon platform. It is trying to provide an interface as close as possible to the standard libraries in order to provide a good user experience.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Go >= 1.20


### Steps

```sh
go get -u github.com/intel/fastgo
```

## Quick Start

```go
// examples/flate/main.go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"io"
	"log"

	"github.com/intel/fastgo/compress/flate"
)

func main() {
	data := []byte(`simple text`)
	var buf bytes.Buffer
	// Create a Writer to compress data
	w, err := flate.NewWriter(&buf, flate.BestSpeed)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	w.Write(data)
	w.Close()

	// Create a Reader to decompress data
	r := flate.NewReader(&buf)
	readData, err := io.ReadAll(r)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Println(bytes.Equal(data, readData))
}

```

### Example 

please check [gzip example](examples/gzip/main.go)

## Features and Functionality

Intel FastGo primarily offers optimizations related to compression and decompression, with a special focus on support for the [Deflate](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951) compression format. This includes enhancements for the compress/flate, compress/gzip, and compress/zlib packages. The APIs provided by Intel FastGo are designed to be consistent with the corresponding standard library interfaces, facilitating a seamless Drop-In Replacement for users.

### Limitations

Currently, Intel FastGo's compression capabilities are optimized only for levels 1, 2, and Huffman-only. At present, both compression and decompression do not support custom dictionaries. In cases where acceleration is not supported, we fallback to processing with the standard library.

### Features
- Deflate
    - Comression Acceleration
        - Level1 
        - Level2
        - Huffmanonly
    - Decompression Acceleration
- Gzip Format
- Zlib Format

### Future Developments
- Custom Dictionary Support: Enabling compression and decompression with custom dictionaries.
- Broader Compression Level Support: Extending optimization to cover more compression levels.
- More Packages Support: Including more packages, e.g. hash/crc32 
- Hardware Accelerator Support: Introducing support for hardware accelerators such as IAA (IntelÂ® In-Memory Accelerator), DSA (Data Streaming Accelerator), and QAT (QuickAssist Technology) in upcoming releases. This enhancement aims to automatically detect specific scenarios and utilize the corresponding hardware accelerators to boost performance.
